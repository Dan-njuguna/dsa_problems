Big O notation

-  **Big O notation** is used to describe the complexity of an algorithm in terms of the input size
- O(n):
for every for loop, (1).
- O(n ^ 2):
for  every nested for loop (+ ^ 1)
- Time: how long does it take to manipulate your data? Is there a shorter time which can be used to do the same task.
- Space
- Accesibility
- Scalability

O(n ^ 1) = O(n)
O(n ^ 2) = O(n ^ 2)
