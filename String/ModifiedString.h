/*
    This file contains the
        1. Struct declaration that holds all the setter functions for the String_type struct
        2. Struct declaration that holds all the getter functions for the String_type struct
        3. Struct declaration that holds all the utils functions for the String_type struct
        4. Struct declaration that holds the struct type enclosing the string
        5. A constructor for the modified string
        6. Helper function declarations for the String_type struct
        7. Helper functions for the whole String_type helper functionsðŸ˜…

    NB: THIS IS NOT IMPORTED, BUT RATHER IMPORT ModifiedString.c

    STANDARDS:
        1. The struct defined holds the necessary structs and helper functions
        2. All private helper functions(those NOT meant for the struct) and variables follow the pattern "_String_(name)" to prevent naming issues
        3. All private variables within the String struct produced are prefixed with 2 underscores, as they are private
        4. The helper functions(those MEANT for the struct) are defined in the format "_String_maker_(helper fn)", to prevent naming issues
        5. The structs types contained within the String_type struct are prefixed with "String_type_(name) to prevent naming conflicts"
